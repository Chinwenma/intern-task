1. What is JavaScript?
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that enables you to create dynamic and interactive content on websites, such as:

Changing HTML content

Handling user events (like clicks)

Making animations

Sending/receiving data from a server (AJAX)

It runs in the browser (client-side), but with tools like Node.js, it can also run on servers (server-side).
