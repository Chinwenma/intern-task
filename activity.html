    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p id="about-me">
        My name is John Doe, and I am a passionate technology enthusiast with a strong interest in software development and design. 
        I have been exploring the world of programming for several years, beginning with simple HTML and CSS projects, and slowly 
        moving on to more complex applications using JavaScript and other modern web technologies. My curiosity and determination 
        to understand how technology shapes our everyday lives drive my learning journey.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        I grew up in a small town where access to technology was limited, but that did not stop me from pursuing my interests. 
        I started learning computer basics in a community cyber café, where I spent countless hours reading about how websites 
        work and trying out small experiments. This humble beginning shaped my resilience and taught me the value of self-learning. 
        I believe that anyone can achieve excellence if they are committed to continuous improvement.
    </p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
        I hold a diploma in Computer Science, which provided me with the foundational knowledge needed to navigate the world 
        of IT. During my studies, I focused on web development, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in depth. Beyond my 
        formal education, I have taken several online courses to improve my skills, including UX design, responsive web design, 
        and backend development. I believe that education is an ongoing process, and I strive to learn something new every day.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
        Over the years, I have worked on multiple personal and group projects. One of my proudest achievements was 
        creating a portfolio website for a local artist, which helped increase their online visibility and client base. 
        I have also participated in several hackathons, where I collaborated with other developers to solve real-world 
        problems within tight deadlines. These experiences taught me teamwork, problem-solving, and the importance of 
        writing clean, maintainable code.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>
        My core skills include HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, but I also have experience with frameworks like React.js and 
        Bootstrap. I am comfortable working with version control systems such as Git and platforms like GitHub. Beyond 
        coding, I possess strong communication and analytical skills, which allow me to effectively convey technical ideas 
        to both technical and non-technical audiences. I am also learning graphic design to enhance the visual appeal 
        of my projects.
    </p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
        My short-term goal is to secure a front-end developer role where I can contribute to real-world projects and 
        improve my skills further. In the long run, I aspire to become a full-stack developer, capable of building 
        complete applications from start to finish. I also want to mentor beginners in tech, helping them avoid 
        the struggles I faced when starting out. I believe that sharing knowledge not only benefits others but also 
        reinforces one’s own understanding.
